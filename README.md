# FlappyAceWin

A flappy bird clone for the Amiga 500

Built using the Amiga C Engine. All in C.

The game is fully working, with the ADF inside Build/ADF. Tested an A500 only. 

It is a little quirky, the collision detection is instant so if you hit a pipe you'll be flashed to the menu pretty quickly.
